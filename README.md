## Description
This respository consists of 3 Example Classes that explore different topics in Algorithm Design and Analysis. The respository houses our code, as well as our presentation slides for each of the example classes. A brief rundown of each example class is given below:

### Example Class 1: Integration of Mergesort & Insertion Sort

### Example Class 2: The Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

### Example Class 3:  Dynamic Programming

## How to run
To run the code, simply download the files into your local drive and open them using your preferred IDE (e.g. Jupyter Notebook). Run all the cells and view the results!
### Notes
